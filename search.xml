    <content type="text"><![CDATA[GoalBuild the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including: Initializing parameters Calculating the cost function and its gradient Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent) Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order. PackagesFirst, let’s run the cell below to import all the packages. numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. h5py is a common package to interact with a dataset that is stored on an H5 file. matplotlib is a famous library to plot graphs in Python. PIL and scipy are used here to test your model with your own picture at the end. 123456789import numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport h5pyimport scipyfrom PIL import Imagefrom scipy import ndimagefrom lr_utils import load_dataset%matplotlib inline Overview of the Problem setThe dataset we will use contains: a training set of m_train images labeled as cat (y=1) or non-cat (y=0) a test set of m_test images labeled as cat or non-cat each image is of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) where 3 is for the 3 channels (RGB). Thus, each image is square (height = num_px) and (width = num_px). First we import the data from file 12# Loading the data (cat/non-cat)train_set_x_orig, train_set_y, test_set_x_orig, test_set_y Now we show information of data, each image is of shape (64, 64, 3) showing it’s 64*64, RGB. 12345678print ("Number of training examples: m_train = " + str(m_train))print ("Number of testing examples: m_test = " + str(m_test))print ("Height/Width of each image: num_px = " + str(num_px))print ("Each image is of size: (" + str(num_px) + ", " + str(num_px) + ", 3)")print ("train_set_x shape: " + str(train_set_x_orig.shape))print ("train_set_y shape: " + str(train_set_y.shape))print ("test_set_x shape: " + str(test_set_x_orig.shape))print ("test_set_y shape: " + str(test_set_y.shape)) Output:Number of training examples: m_train = 209Number of testing examples: m_test = 50Height/Width of each image: num_px = 64Each image is of size: (64, 64, 3)train_set_x shape: (209, 64, 64, 3)train_set_y shape: (1, 209)test_set_x shape: (50, 64, 64, 3)test_set_y shape: (1, 50) Then we reshape the training and test dataset to column vector:1234print ("train_set_x_flatten shape: " + str(train_set_x_flatten.shape))print ("train_set_y shape: " + str(train_set_y.shape))print ("test_set_x_flatten shape: " + str(test_set_x_flatten.shape))print ("test_set_y shape: " + str(test_set_y.shape)) Output:train_set_x_flatten shape: (12288, 209)train_set_y shape: (1, 209)test_set_x_flatten shape: (12288, 50)test_set_y shape: (1, 50) At last, let’s standardize our dataset:12train_set_x = train_set_x_flatten/255.test_set_x = test_set_x_flatten/255. Mathematical expression of the algorithm Step Initialize the parameters of the model Learn the parameters for the model by minimizing the cost Use the learned parameters to make predictions (on the test set) Analyse the results and conclude For one example $x^{(i)}$:$$z^{(i)} = w^T x^{(i)} + b \tag{1}$$$$\hat{y}^{(i)} = a^{(i)} = sigmoid(z^{(i)})\tag{2}$$$$ \mathcal{L}(a^{(i)}, y^{(i)}) = - y^{(i)} \log(a^{(i)}) - (1-y^{(i)} ) \log(1-a^{(i)})\tag{3}$$ The cost is then computed by summing over all training examples:$$ J = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \mathcal{L}(a^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\tag{6}$$ Building the parts of our algorithm StepThe main steps for building a Neural Network are: Define the model structure (such as number of input features) Initialize the model’s parameters Loop: Calculate current loss (forward propagation) Calculate current gradient (backward propagation) Update parameters (gradient descent) Forward and Backward propagationForward Propagation: You get X You compute $A = \sigma(w^T X + b) = (a^{(0)}, a^{(1)}, …, a^{(m-1)}, a^{(m)})$ You calculate the cost function: $J = -\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}y^{(i)}\log(a^{(i)})+(1-y^{(i)})\log(1-a^{(i)})$ Here are the two formulas you will be using: $$ \frac{\partial J}{\partial w} = \frac{1}{m}X(A-Y)^T$$ $$ \frac{\partial J}{\partial b} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m (a^{(i)}-y^{(i)})$$ Here is the Forward-propagation function:1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435def propagate(w, b, X, Y):"""Implement the cost function and its gradient for the propagation explained aboveArguments:w -- weights, a numpy array of size (num_px * num_px * 3, 1)b -- bias, a scalarX -- data of size (num_px * num_px * 3, number of examples)Y -- true "label" vector (containing 0 if non-cat, 1 if cat) of size (1, number of examples)Return:cost -- negative log-likelihood cost for logistic regressiondw -- gradient of the loss with respect to w, thus same shape as wdb -- gradient of the loss with respect to b, thus same shape as b"""m = X.shape[1]# FORWARD PROPAGATION (FROM X TO COST)# compute activation (1, number of examples)A = sigmoid(np.dot(w.T, X) + b)# compute costcost = -1.0/m * np.sum(Y*np.log(A) + (1-Y)*np.log(1-A))# BACKWARD PROPAGATION (TO FIND GRAD)# compute gradientdw = 1.0/m*np.dot(X, (A-Y).T)db = 1.0/m*np.sum(A-Y)cost = np.squeeze(cost)grads = &#123;"dw": dw,"db": db&#125;return grads, cost 12345w, b, X, Y = np.array([[1.],[2.]]), 2., np.array([[1.,2.,-1.],[3.,4.,-3.2]]), np.array([[1,0,1]])grads, cost = propagate(w, b, X, Y)print (&quot;dw = &quot; + str(grads[&quot;dw&quot;]))print (&quot;db = &quot; + str(grads[&quot;db&quot;]))print (&quot;cost = &quot; + str(cost)) Output:dw = [[ 0.99845601][ 2.39507239]]db = 0.00145557813678cost = 5.80154531939 Optimization123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142434445464748495051525354def optimize(w, b, X, Y, num_iterations, learning_rate, print_cost = False):&quot;&quot;&quot;This function optimizes w and b by running a gradient descent algorithmArguments:w -- weights, a numpy array of size (num_px * num_px * 3, 1)b -- bias, a scalarX -- data of shape (num_px * num_px * 3, number of examples)Y -- true &quot;label&quot; vector (containing 0 if non-cat, 1 if cat), of shape (1, number of examples)num_iterations -- number of iterations of the optimization looplearning_rate -- learning rate of the gradient descent update ruleprint_cost -- True to print the loss every 100 stepsReturns:params -- dictionary containing the weights w and bias bgrads -- dictionary containing the gradients of the weights and bias with respect to the cost functioncosts -- list of all the costs computed during the optimization, this will be used to plot the learning curve.Tips:1) Calculate the cost and the gradient for the current parameters.

This is a good sanity check: your model is working and has high enough capacity to fit the training data. Test error is 68%. It is actually not bad for this simple model, given the small dataset we used and that logistic regression is a linear classifier. Also, you see that the model is clearly overfitting the training data.

    <url>%2F2018%2F02%2F08%2FPython-Broadcasting%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[VectorizationIn the course Neural Networks and Deep Learning, Andrew Ng introduces vetorization in machine learning by giving the following examples: 123456789101112131415161718192021222324import numpy as npimport timea = np.random.rand(1000000)b = np.random.rand(1000000)# vectorizationtic = time.time()c = np.dot(a,b)toc = time.time()print(c)print("Vectorization:" + str(1000*(toc-tic)) + "ms")c = 0# vectorizationtic = time.time()for i in range(1000000):c += a[i]*b[i]toc = time.time()print(c)print("For loop:" + str(1000*(toc-tic)) + "ms") The above code uses vetorization and for loop to do the same calculation. However, the for loop version cost much more time than the vectorization version. Output:249888.154501Vectorization:2.2249221801757812ms249888.154501For loop:599.0450382232666ms The above example indicates that in python it’s more efficient to use vectorization instead of for loop. This kind of technique is also called SIMD(single instruction multiple data) in CPU/GPU parallel processing. Broadcasting The term broadcasting describes how numpy treats arrays with different shapes during arithmetic operations. Subject to certain constraints, the smaller array is “broadcast” across the larger array so that they have compatible shapes. Broadcasting provides a means of vectorizing array operations so that looping occurs in C instead of Python. It does this without making needless copies of data and usually leads to efficient algorithm implementations. NumPy operations are usually done on pairs of arrays on an element-by-element basis. In the simplest case, the two arrays must have exactly the same shape, as in the following example: 1234&gt;&gt;&gt; a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])&gt;&gt;&gt; b = np.array([2.0, 2.0, 2.0])&gt;&gt;&gt; a * barray([ 2., 4., 6.]) NumPy’s broadcasting rule relaxes this constraint when the arrays’ shapes meet certain constraints. The simplest broadcasting example occurs when an array and a scalar value are combined in an operation: 1234&gt;&gt;&gt; a = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])&gt;&gt;&gt; b = 2.0&gt;&gt;&gt; a * barray([ 2., 4., 6.]) The result is equivalent to the previous example where b was an array. We can think of the scalar b being stretched during the arithmetic operation into an array with the same shape as a. The new elements in b are simply copies of the original scalar. The stretching analogy is only conceptual. NumPy is smart enough to use the original scalar value without actually making copies, so that broadcasting operations are as memory and computationally efficient as possible. The code in the second example is more efficient than that in the first because broadcasting moves less memory around during the multiplication (b is a scalar rather than an array). General Broadcasting RulesWhen operating on two arrays, NumPy compares their shapes element-wise. It starts with the trailing dimensions, and works its way forward. Two dimensions are compatible when they are equal one of them is 1 Arrays don’t have to have the same number of dimensions. For example, if you have a 256x256x3 array of RGB values, and you want to scale each color in the image by a different value, you can multiply the image by a one-dimensional array with 3 values. Image (3d array): 256 x 256 x 3Scale (1d array): 3Result (3d array): 256 x 256 x 3 When either of the dimensions compared is one, the other is used. In other words, dimensions with size 1 are stretched or “copied” to match the other. A (4d array): 8 x 1 x 6 x 1B (3d array): 7 x 1 x 5Result (4d array): 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 A (2d array): 5 x 4B (1d array): 1Result (2d array): 5 x 4 A (2d array): 5 x 4B (1d array): 4Result (2d array): 5 x 4 A (3d array): 15 x 3 x 5B (3d array): 15 x 1 x 5Result (3d array): 15 x 3 x 5 A (3d array): 15 x 3 x 5B (2d array): 3 x 5Result (3d array): 15 x 3 x 5 Here are examples of shapes that do not broadcast: A (1d array): 3B (1d array): 4 # trailing dimensions do not match A (2d array): 2 x 1B (3d array): 8 x 4 x 3 # second from last dimensions mismatched References Neural Networks and Deep Learning Broadcasting — NumPy v1.12 Manual]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. Vector representation and Dimensionality reduction of dataIn general, in data mining and machine learning, data are represented as vectors.For example:$$ (500,240,25,13,2312.15)^𝖳 $$ As we know, the scale of dimensionality of data is in proportion to complexity of machine learning algorithm, so we can reduce dimensionality to simplify calculation. Obviuosly, dimensionality reduction means loss of information. However, due to the correlation among data, we could minimize the loss in the above process, which is the purpose of PCA. Change of basesInner productInner product of two vectors is defined as: $$ (a_1,a_2,⋯,a_n)^𝖳⋅(b_1,b_2,⋯,b_n)^𝖳=a_1b_1+a_2b_2+⋯+a_nb_n $$ and $$ A⋅B=|A||B|cos(a) $$ Let |B| = 1, that is $ A⋅B=|A|cos(a) $. The above definition could be explained that the inner product of A and B equals the vector length projected from A to B. BaseTo describe a vector, we need a set of bases. Then the vector could be represented as the combination of projections to all bases. Usually, we choose (1,0) and (0,1) as bases, but actually we can choose any two linearly independent vectors as bases. For example, we can use $ (\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) $ and $ (\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) $ as new bases to represent the same vector. Matrix representation of form changeFor example, we want to transform (3, 2) based on new bases $ (\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) $ and $ (\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) $, which could be represented by the following form: $$\left(\begin{matrix}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\end{matrix}\right)\left(\begin{matrix}1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3\end{matrix}\right)=\left(\begin{matrix}\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{4}{\sqrt{2}} &amp; \frac{6}{\sqrt{2}} \\0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\end{matrix}\right)$$ In general, if we have M N-dimesion vector and want to transform them into R N-dimesion new spaces, we first construct matrix A combining R bases by row, then construct matrix B combining vectors by column. The product of A and B is the result, where the column in AB is transformed from column in A. The above shows an explanation of matrix product:product of two matrices(AB) means to transform each column vector in B to the new space with rows in A as bases.]]></content>
